[ ] Choose five images containing lines and rectangular structures.
Examples of such images are those from urban scenes, buildings facades, repeated patterns (fences, trees,
regular textures). The idea is that these images should contain a
sufficient number of line segments (> 30)

[ ] Design and Implement an algorithm for automatic detection of
lines:
    [x] RANSAC with Least Squares fitting, or the
    Hough Transform
be creative and try to develop a method that works well. Design it and implement it yourself!

[ ] Design and Implement a method for automatic detection of
rectangular structures, using the output from B. Examples of such
structures could be windows, houses, parts of cars or buildings â€“
many man-made structures contain rectangular subparts
